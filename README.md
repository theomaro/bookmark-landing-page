## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) language
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

#### Use group modifiers to handle states

- From this project I learn how I can style an element based on the state of its parent element using a tailwind group modifiers classes
- In the code below, The humberger menu bars are styled and made responsive by only controlling the parent element class.

```html
<div class="group is-open">
  <span
    class="group-[.is-open]:rotate-45 group-[.is-open]:translate-y-1 group-[.is-open]:bg-white"
  ></span>
  <span class="group-[.is-open]:hidden"></span>
  <span
    class="group-[.is-open]:-rotate-45 group-[.is-open]:-translate-y-1 group-[.is-open]:bg-white"
  ></span>
</div>
```

### Continued development

Some of the areas that I wish to continue focusing on in future projects are:-

- CSS Positioning
- Animations
- Responsive Design techniques
